    "**Exercise:**  This exercise is inspired by a true story.  In 2001 I created [Green Tea Press](https://greenteapress.com) to publish my books, starting with *Think Python*.  I ordered 100 copies from a short run printer and made the book available for sale through a distributor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After the first week, the distributor reported that 12 copies were sold.  Based that report, I thought I would run out of copies in about 8 weeks, so I got ready to order more.  My printer offered me a discount if I ordered more than 1000 copies, so I went a little crazy and ordered 2000.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A few days later, my mother called to tell me that her *copies* of the book had arrived.  Surprised, I asked how many.  She said ten.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turned out I had sold only two books to non-relatives.  And it took a lot longer than I expected to sell 2000 copies."

    "The details of this story are unique, but the general problem is something almost every retailer has to figure out.  Based on past sales, how do you predict future sales?  And based on those predictions, how do you decide how much to order and when?\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the cost of a bad decision is complicated.  If you place a lot of small orders rather than one big one, your costs are likely to be higher.  If you run out of inventory, you might lose customers.  And if you order too much, you have to pay the various costs of holding inventory.\n",
