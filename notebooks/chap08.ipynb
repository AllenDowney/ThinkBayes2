    "\n",
    ">In the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Germany played Brazil in a semifinal match. Germany scored after 11 minutes and again at the 23 minute mark. At that point in the match, how many goals would you expect Germany to score after 90 minutes? What was the probability that they would score 5 more goals (as, in fact, they did)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version, notice that the data is not the number of goals in a fixed period of time, but the time between goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the likelihood of data like this, we can take advantage of the theory of Poisson processes again.  If each team has a constant goal-scoring rate, we expect the time between goals to follow an [exponential distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the goal-scoring rate is $\\lambda$, the probability of seeing an interval between goals of $t$ is proportional to the PDF of the exponential distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $t$ is a continuous quantity, the value of this expression is not a probability; it is a probability density.  However, it is proportional to the probability of the data, so we can use it as a likelihood in a Bayesian update.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy provides `expon`, which creates an object that represents an exponential distribution.\n",
    "However, it does not take `lam` as a parameter in the way you might expect, which makes it awkward to work with.\n",
    "Since the PDF of the exponential distribution is so easy to evaluate, I'll use my own function."

    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces three new distributions, so it can be hard to keep them straight.\n",
    "Let's review:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a system satisfies the assumptions of a Poisson model, the number of events in a period of time follows a Poisson distribution, which is a discrete distribution with integer quantities from 0 to infinity. In practice, we can usually ignore low-probability quantities above a finite limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also under the Poisson model, the interval between events follows an exponential distribution, which is a continuous distribution with quantities from 0 to infinity. Because it is continuous, it is described by a probability density function (PDF) rather than a probability mass function (PMF). But when we use an exponential distribution to compute the likelihood of the data, we can treat densities as unnormalized probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Poisson and exponential distributions are parameterized by an event rate, denoted $\\lambda$ or `lam`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the prior distribution of $\\lambda$, I used a gamma distribution, which is a continuous distribution with quantities from 0 to infinity, but I approximated it with a discrete, bounded PMF. The gamma distribution has one parameter, denoted $\\alpha$ or `alpha`, which is also its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the gamma distribution because the shape is consistent with our background knowledge about goal-scoring rates.\n",
    "There are other distributions we could have used; however, we will see in <<_ConjugatePriors>> that the gamma distribution can be a particularly good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we have a few things to do before we get there, starting with these exercises."
