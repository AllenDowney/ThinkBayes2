    "In this example, the non-naive classifier is only marginally better.\n",
    "In one way, that's disappointing.  After all that work, it would have been nice to see a bigger improvement.\n",
    "But in another way, it's good news.  In general, a naive Bayesian classifier is easier to implement and requires less computation.  If it works nearly as well as a more complex algorithm, it might be a good choice for practical purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of practical purposes, you might have noticed that this example isn't very useful.  If we want to identify the species of a penguin, there are easier ways than measuring its flippers and beak.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there *are* scientific uses for this type of classification.  One of them is the subject of the research paper we started with: [sexual dimorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism), that is, differences in shape between male and female animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some species, like angler fish, males and females look very different.  In other species, like mockingbirds, they are difficult to tell apart.\n",
    "And dimorphism is worth studying because it provides insight into social behavior, sexual selection, and evolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to quantify the degree of sexual dimorphism in a species is to use a classification algorithm like the one in this chapter.  If you can find a set of features that makes it possible to classify individuals by sex with high accuracy, that's evidence of high dimorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, you can use the dataset from this chapter to classify penguins by sex and see which of the three species is the most dimorphic."
