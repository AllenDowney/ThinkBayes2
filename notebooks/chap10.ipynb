    "\n",
    "In statistical hypothesis testing, we compute a p-value, which is hard to define concisely, and use it to determine whether the results are \"statistically significant\", which is also  hard to define concisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian alternative is to report the Bayes factor, $K$, which summarizes the strength of the evidence in favor of one hypothesis or the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people think it is better to report $K$ than a posterior probability because $K$ does not depend on a prior probability.\n",
    "But as we saw in this example, $K$ often depends on a precise definition of the hypotheses, which can be just as controversial as a prior probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, Bayesian hypothesis testing is better because it measures the strength of the evidence on a continuum, rather that trying to make a binary determination.\n",
    "But it doesn't solve what I think is the fundamental problem, which is that hypothesis testing is not asking the question we really care about."
