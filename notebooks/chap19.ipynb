    "Then we implemented a multiple regression model that would not have been possible to compute with a grid approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCMC is more powerful than grid methods, but that power comes with some disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MCMC algorithms are fiddly.  The same model might behave well with some priors and less well with others.  And the sampling process often produces warnings about tuning steps, divergences, \"r-hat statistics\", acceptance rates, and effective samples.  It takes some expertise to diagnose and correct these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I find it easier to develop models incrementally using grid algorithms, checking intermediate results along the way.  With PyMC3, it is not as easy to be confident that you have specified a model correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, I recommend a model development process that starts with grid algorithms and resorts to MCMC if necessary.\n",
    "As we saw in the previous chapters, you can solve a lot of real-world problems with grid methods.\n",
    "But when you need MCMC, it is useful to have a grid algorithm to compare to (even if it is based on a simpler model).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the models in this book can be implemented in PyMC3, but some of them are easier to translate than others.\n",

Maybe there are hundreds of bugs. How can you have any idea how many bugs there are? There's no way to know with one tester. But if you have two testers, you can get a good idea, even if you don't know how skilled the testers are.\"\n",
