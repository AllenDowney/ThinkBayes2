    "The definitive elements of ABC are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A prior distribution of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A simulation of the system that generates the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A criterion for when we should accept that the output of the simulation matches the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ABC is particularly useful when the system is too complex to model with tools like PyMC.\n",
    "For example, it might involve a physical simulation based on differential equations.\n",
    "In that case, each simulation might require substantial computation, and many simulations might be needed to estimate the posterior distribution.\n",

    "**Exercise:** This exercise is based on [a blog post by Rasmus Bååth](http://www.sumsar.net/blog/2014/10/tiny-data-and-the-socks-of-karl-broman), which is motivated by a tweet from Karl Broman, who wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    "> That the first 11 socks in the laundry are distinct suggests that there are a lot of socks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you pull 11 socks out of the laundry and find that no two of them make a matched pair.  Estimate the number of socks in the laundry.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we'll use the model Bååth suggests, which is based on these assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The laundry contains some number of pairs of socks, `n_pairs`, plus some number of odd (unpaired) socks, `n_odds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The pairs of socks are different from each other and different from the unpaired socks; in other words, the number of socks of each type is either 1 or 2, never more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the prior distributions Bååth suggests, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of socks follows a negative binomial distribution with mean 30 and standard deviation 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The proportion of socks that are paired follows a beta distribution with parameters `alpha=15` and `beta=2`.\n",
    "\n",
