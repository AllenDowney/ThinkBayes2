    "We'll use `Pmf` and other classes from `empiricaldist` throughout the book because they simplify the code and make it more readable.\n",
    "But it would be easy to do the same things directly with Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a `Pmf` to solve the cookie problem and the dice problem, which we saw in the previous chapter.\n",
    "With a `Pmf` it is easy to perform sequential updates with multiple pieces of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also solved a more general version of the cookie problem, with 101 bowls rather than two.\n",
    "Then we computed the MAP, which is the quantity with the highest posterior probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, I'll introduce the Euro problem, and we will use the binomial distribution.\n",
