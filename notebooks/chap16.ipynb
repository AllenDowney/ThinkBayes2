Of the previous 24 flights, data were available on failures of O-rings on 23 (one was lost at sea), and these data were discussed on the evening preceding the Challenger launch, but unfortunately only the data corresponding to the 7 flights on which there was a damage incident were considered important and these were thought to show no obvious trend.\"\n",

    "This form of Bayes's Theorem is also the foundation of logistic regression, which we used to infer parameters and make predictions.  In the Space Shuttle problem, we modeled the relationship between temperature and the probability of damage, and showed that the Challenger disaster might have been predictable.  But this example is also a warning about the hazards of using a model to extrapolate far beyond the data.\n",
