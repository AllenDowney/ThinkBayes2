    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces survival analysis, which is used to answer questions about the time until an event, and the Weibull distribution, which is a good model for \"lifetimes\" (broadly interpreted) in a number of domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used joint distributions to represent prior probabilities for the parameters of the Weibull distribution, and we updated them three ways: knowing the exact duration of a lifetime, knowing a lower bound, and knowing that a lifetime fell in a given interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate a feature of Bayesian methods: they can be adapted to handle incomplete, or \"censored\", data with only small changes.  As an exercise, you'll have a chance to work with one more type of censored data, when we are given an upper bound on a lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods in this chapter work with any distribution with two parameters.\n",
    "In the exercises, you'll have a chance to estimate the parameters of a two-parameter gamma distribution, which is used to describe a variety of natural phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in the next chapter we'll move on to models with three parameters!"
