    "More generally, suppose the probability of heads is $p$ and we spin the coin $n$ times.  The probability that we get a total of $k$ heads is given by the [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution):\n",

    "In this chapter I posed David MacKay's Euro problem and we started to solve it.\n",
    "Given the data, we computed the posterior distribution for `x`, the probability a Euro coin comes up heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tried two different priors, updated them with the same data, and found that the posteriors were nearly the same.\n",
    "This is good news, because it suggests that if two people start with different beliefs and see the same data, their beliefs tend to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces the binomial distribution, which we used to compute the posterior distribution more efficiently.\n",
    "And I discussed the differences between applying Bayes's Theorem, as in the 101 Bowls problem, and doing Bayesian statistics, as in the Euro problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we still haven't answered MacKay's question: \"Do these data give evidence that the coin is biased rather than fair?\"\n",
    "I'm going to leave this question hanging a little longer; we'll come back to it in <<_Testing>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we'll solve problems related to counting, including trains, tanks, and rabbits.\n",
