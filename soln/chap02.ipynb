    "If the Monty Hall problem makes your head hurt, you are not alone.  But I think it demonstrates the power of Bayes's Theorem as a divide-and-conquer strategy for solving tricky problems.  And I hope it provides some insight into *why* the answer is what it is.\n",

    "When Monty opens a door, he provides information we can use to update our belief about the location of the car.  Part of the information is obvious.  If he opens Door 3, we know the car is not behind Door 3.  But part of the information is more subtle.  Opening Door 3 is more likely if the car is behind Door 2, and less likely if it is behind Door 1.  So the data is evidence in favor of Door 2.  We will come back to this notion of evidence in future chapters.\n",
