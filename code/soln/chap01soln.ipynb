    "2. $P(D|H)$ is the likelihood of the data, which is the chance of getting a vanilla cookie if $H$ is true, in other words, the chance of getting a vanilla cookie from Bowl 1, which is $30/40$ or $3/4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $P(D)$ is the total probability of the data, which is the chance of getting a vanilla cookie whether $H$ is true or not.  In this example, we can figure out $P(D)$ directly: because the bowls are equally likely, and they contain the same number of cookies, you were equally likely to choose any cookie.  Combining the two bowls, there are 50 vanilla and 30 chocolate cookies, so the probability of choosing a vanilla cookie is $50/80$ or $5/8$.\n",
